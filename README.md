<p align="left">The objective of this project is to analyze the 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users and predict which previously purchased item will be in user's next order. Customer segmentation and affinity analysis are done to study customer purchase patterns and for better product marketing and cross-selling.<p>

<p align="left">Company X has an attrition problem. Employee turnover is a serious problem for a company, it costs the company approximately 20% of that employee's salary to replace them. Not to mention the time and loss in productivity. Company X's HR department has given some data about their employees both existing employees and those who left. They want to have insights as to why employees are leaving, but most importantly they want a predictive model to say which employees are likely to leave.<p>
<p align="left">In this project, Python was used for the analysis<p>

<p align="left"> The organization looks to predict the ideal income (the maximum amount that will last until death with a certain confidence level), a person must draw from retirement using personal, investment and retirement data. Ideal income is defined as the maximum amount that will last until death with a certain confidence level..<p>
<p align="left">In this project, various machine learning models were employed. The focus was to find a model that helps reduce over-fitting, gives a low RMSE, can compute prediction at a faster rate and consumes low memory.<p>
<p align="left">Models such as CatBoost, XGBoost and LightGBM were used.<p>
